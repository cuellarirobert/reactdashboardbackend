 },
 {
   "Question": "How can I create custom selection in MapsIndoors?",
   "Answer": "You can create custom selection in MapsIndoors by using display rules to adjust the appearance of location results programmatically. Here's an example of how to set locations, especially polygons, to red and reset the display rule back to their original settings using setDisplayRule(id, null):\n\n```javascript\nlet previousLocationIds = []; // Keep track of previously selected locations\n\n// Custom selection function\nconst selectLocations = (locationIds, rule) => {\n    // Clear display rules of previously selected locations\n    if(previousLocationIds.length > 0) {\n        clearSelection(previousLocationIds);\n    }\n\n    // Apply the display rule to all the locations\n    locationIds.forEach(id => {\n        mapsIndoorsInstance.setDisplayRule(id, rule);\n    });\n\n    // Update the list of previously selected locations\n    previousLocationIds = locationIds;\n};\n\nconst clearSelection = (locationIds) => {\n    // Reset the display rule of all the locations\n    locationIds.forEach(id => {\n        mapsIndoorsInstance.setDisplayRule(id, null);\n    });\n};\n\nconst rule = { \n    visible: true,\n    polygonVisible: true,\n    polygonFillColor: \"#FF0000\",\n    polygonFillOpacity: 1,\n    iconSize: \n    {\n        width: 30,\n        height: 30\n    },\n    labelVisible: true,\n};\n```\n",
   "Context": "In this code example, you can create custom selection by defining a selection function that applies a display rule to specified location IDs. The code allows you to set the locations, particularly polygons, to a red color and provides a way to reset the display rule for those locations. This custom selection method enables you to adjust the appearance of location results according to your specific requirements. This will impact what the visibility looks like if polygonVisibility is set to true in the display rule."

 {
   "Question": "How can I hide all other content on the map except what I'd like to filter?",
   "Answer": "Hiding all other content on the map, except what you'd like to filter, is primarily relevant when working with Raster tiles. However, keep in mind that hiding all other content may result in very limited visibility on the map for users. To achieve this, you can use the `mapsIndoorsInstance.filter(locationIds)` method after performing a search. The `filter` parameter should be an array of location IDs to filter the map by. You can pass `null` as the filter to clear the filter.",
   "Context": "The provided code example demonstrates how to filter locations based on category and provides a way to control the visibility of specific location content on the map. It's important to consider the implications of hiding all other content, as it may result in a limited map view for users."

      "Step 4": "Assuming the first location in the 'locations' array is relevant, retrieve it as 'location'. You can then optionally set the floor and center the map based on this location's information.",
      "Step 5": "Use 'mapsIndoorsInstance.setFloor(location.properties.floor)' or a known floor index to set the floor if they are all on the same floor, and 'mapInstance.setCenter' to center the map based on the location's anchor coordinates, or you may wish to find another way to center the map with some other data.",
